# ProfileWindows-EO
EtternaOnline profile script to allow opening links inside a window

This is a script to make the user profile page load links in a little window instead of reirecting. These links include:
- Score links (basically scores listed in Recent and Top 10)
- View All button (to see all scores more quickly)
- Song links (for example song links next to the scores and goals or songs in favourites)

## How to install
- Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser
- Copy the JavaScript (.js) file
- Create a new script on Tampermonkey and paste
